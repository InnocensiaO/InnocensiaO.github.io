<h1><b>Data collection</b></h1>
     <p>The code and data for various project I have worked in can be found through this github <a href="https://github.com/InnocensiaO"> link.</a>
     Geodata from digital sources can be accessed through Application Programming Interface(APIs) or webpage scraping. 
    The code for obtaining data through APIs or scraping can be found in this github repository<a href="https://github.com/InnocensiaO/datacollector"> Python code.</a>
</p>
<h3>APIs</h3>
    <p>This is the best avenue for accessing data from a social media applications as they are the official channel websites use to share their data in a manner that ensures their applications are not overrun with requests. I have gathered data using APIs from the following websites. For Twitter, Wikpedia and Flickr the data was downloaded to a PostgrSQL database. </p>

<h3>Webpage scraping</h3>
    <p>This might result to your IP address being blocked, therefore use with caution.Check the the site's robots.txt file to learn about accessible URLs.
        
    A python web scraper can provide free alternative comprehensive access to the website's data using libraries such as Selenium WebDriver for web browser automation functionality which mimic user browsing interactions and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML document. BeautifulSoup parses texts from the HTML document to extract review content. Yelp, GoogleMaps and TripAdvisor apages were scraped and the data dowloaded as CSV files.</p>
